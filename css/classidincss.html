<!--
You declare a CSS class by using a dot (.) followed by the class name. You make up the class name yourself.
 After the class name you simply enter the properties/values that you want to assign to your class.

CLASS SYNTAX:
.class-name { property:value; }
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<title> class and id in css </title>
<style>
  div.css-section { 
    border:1px dotted red; 
    padding: 20px;
    }
  p.css-section { 
    color:green; 
    }
	
	 div#css-section { 
    border:2px solid red; 
    padding: 20px;
    }
</style>
<div class="css-section">CSS Class</div>
<p class="css-section">CSS classes can be very useful</p>


<!--The syntax for declaring a CSS ID is the same as for classes, except that instead of using a dot, you use a hash (#).


#id-name { property:value; }
-->

<div id="css-section">
  This lucky div has ID...
</div>

When to use classes

You should use classes when your style needs to be applied multiple times on the same page.
 For example, you might have many <h1> elements that need the same style applied.

When to use IDs

You should use IDs if only one element on the page should have the style applied,
 and/or you need a unique identifier for that element.
 For example, you might assign an ID to a <nav> tag which contains your left menu. 
 The styles for this ID could contain the position,
 background-color, float properties, size etc.
